  About Carmichael
</h1>
<hr />
<p>Carmichael Monaco, L.Ac. graduated from Tri-State College of Acupuncture in 2015. She practices an integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Kiiko Matsumoto's style of Japanese acupuncture, and Mark Seem's style of trigger point work. She has worked at the Third Root Community Health Care Center in Flatbush and City Acupuncture in the East Village as well as in her own private practice in Brooklyn.

Many people in this city have pain every day-physical and emotional. They/we often have to work through that pain to get by, and many of them/us feel unable for whatever reason to get help from Western medicine. In her private practice and community clinics, Carmichael has focused on treating patients with aches and pains (including low back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, fibromyalgia, chronic and acute pain from injuries, pinched nerves, osteoarthritis, muscle tension, etc.) She regularly treats stress, anxiety, insomnia, depression, allergies, colds, digestive complaints, infertility, and fatigue. She's had extensive training in trigger points and uses them regularly. She also uses moxa, cupping, and gua sha when appropriate.

Carmichael went into acupuncture after many years in the restaurant industry because she saw her friends and coworkers struggle with medical bills and student loan debt, working jobs that don't provide health insurance, and being forced to go into work when sick. Also volunteering at Bluestockings for many of those years, she met a lot of people who worked long hours doing social justice work for which they often didn't get paid. She met an acupuncturist through those people and was amazed by how much better she felt after treatments. She also saw many people often marginalized by the health care industry-queer people, people of color, and working class people-getting respectful, compassionate, quality health care through acupuncture. Carmichael is an acupuncturist because she wants her livelihood to help people become stronger, so that they are more able to both fight against injustices and enjoy their lives.
